# YellowCorp package tracker

A simple web app that displays a list of orders (or parcels). \
More details are shown when the user clicks on a particular parcel, for example: order status, ETAs, pickup location. 

This project was created as a student project for Software Development Academy (SDA). \
It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and supports major mobile and desktop browsers/layouts.

The web app is hosted at https://package-tracker-sda9.web.app/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies (read on for details) in the local node_modules folder.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is then ready to be deployed!
